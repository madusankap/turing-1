      <h2>Disclaimer</h2>
      <p>Apache Amber is an effort undergoing <a href="http://incubator.apache.org/">incubation</a> at
      The Apache Software Foundation (ASF), sponsored by the Apache Incubator PMC. Incubation is required of all newly
      accepted projects until a further review indicates that the infrastructure, communications, and decision making
      process have stabilized in a manner consistent with other successful ASF projects.
      While incubation status is not necessarily a reflection of the completeness or stability of the code,
      it does indicate that the project has yet to be fully endorsed by the ASF.</p>
      <p>You can view our current <a href="http://incubator.apache.org/projects/amber.html">incubation status</a>
      for more details.</p>
